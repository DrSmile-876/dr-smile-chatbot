  <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>By using the Dr. Smile Chatbot, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the chatbot service.</p>

  <h2>Service Purpose</h2>

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>Dr. Smile is not responsible for any decisions made based on the chatbotâ€™s responses. Always consult a licensed dentist for dental issues.</p>

  <h2>Availability</h2>
  <p>We aim to offer 24/7 chatbot access but cannot guarantee uninterrupted service.</p>

  <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>These terms may be updated at any time. Continued use of the chatbot after changes means you agree to the new terms.</p>
